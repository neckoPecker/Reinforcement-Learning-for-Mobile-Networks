* Reinforcement-Learning-For-Mobile-Networks
** About the research
From May 2024 to August 2024, I had the pleasure to partake in
undergraduate research for ways to ways to apply Reinforcement
Learning (RL) to solve a problem. I chose mobile networks because
there were only a handful of researchers who RL to mobile networks,
mostly through a simulation. This repository reflects my understanding
of their works and my own tested experiences.

** What this repository contains

+ The research poster I presented
+ Works that I used to learn/cite in my work
+ Some coding examples using Python
